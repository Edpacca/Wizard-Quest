Developing a small Love2D game in Lua, to actively learn and develop skills.

Submitted for final project of the Harvard CS50 online course. The basic code (animation, map building) came from their coursework example, which I have modified to suit my own needs. All artwork is made from scratch by myself.

Currently very basic, and just a bit of fun. Something to add to over the course of the COVID lock-in!
